# Java-PriorityQueue

## Ben Schwartz

This is a high school project that provides a Java implementation of priority queues, consisting of the following files:

- `HeapPriorityQueue.java`: defines a priority queue class that uses a binary heap data structure for efficient insertion and removal of elements
- `MaxPriorityQueue.java`: defines an interface for priority queues that includes methods for adding and removing elements, as well as querying the size and maximum element
- `HeapRunner.java`: a demo program that creates and manipulates instances of the `HeapPriorityQueue` class


Please note that this is a high school project, and may not be as feature-rich or optimized as other priority queue libraries. It is intended as a learning exercise and is not intended for production use.
